# Nucleotide to Protein Translator (Clinical OOP Edition)

This Python script translates a DNA nucleotide sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

## Purpose
Developed as part of clinical bioinformatics training in line with departmental SOPs on software development, version control, and traceability.

## Features
- Input via command-line (`--seq`)
- Validation of sequence (length, valid bases)
- Codon-to-amino acid translation using standard genetic code
- Designed for clinical code reuse and clarity

## Usage
```bash
python3 translate_v1.py --seq ATGGCGTAA
